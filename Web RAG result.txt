  ✓ Extracted business rules successfully.

--- Extracted Business Rules ---
Here are the business rules related to automating Return on Investment (ROI) analysis:

1.  **Process Selection for Automation to Achieve ROI:**
    *   Prioritize processes that execute with high frequency (daily or multiple times daily) to maximize potential time savings.
    *   Select processes with clear, standardized, and documented rules to facilitate automation.
    *   Target processes that currently incur high labor costs due to manual execution by expensive personnel or during premium time.
    *   Choose processes with a high manual error rate to leverage significant error reduction value from automation.
    *   Focus on processes with clear, quantifiable, and measurable outputs for accurate ROI analysis.
    *   Utilize a Quick-Win Selection Framework by documenting repetitive processes, measuring their frequency and current time investment, identifying explicit business rules, and assessing data quality and system accessibility.
    *   Score processes on frequency, time investment, labor cost, error risk, and standardization to determine an Automation Priority Score.
    *   Rate high-scoring processes on data accessibility, system integration, rule complexity, exception frequency, and stakeholder complexity for an Implementation Complexity Assessment.
    *   Select processes for automation with an Automation Priority Score greater than 7.0 and an Implementation Complexity Score less than 4.0 for optimal rapid ROI.
    *   Choose processes with an estimated implementation time of less than 14 days to ensure quick ROI realization.
    *   Consider initial automation of high-impact, high-frequency tasks such as email management, data entry, or invoice processing for a higher probability of 30-day ROI.

2.  **Automation Implementation for ROI Achievement and Analysis:**
    *   Ensure active stakeholder and end-user involvement from the project's inception.
    *   Ensure data is clean, organized, and accessible before automation implementation.
    *   Define clear, specific, and measurable success metrics for automation projects prior to implementation.
    *   Favor user-friendly, no-code platforms for automation to facilitate ease of use and rapid deployment.
    *   Implement automation through gradual, phased rollouts and pilot testing.
    *   Set up the automation platform and basic integrations in the initial phase of implementation.
    *   Create a dedicated test environment with sample data for thorough automation testing.
    *   Train primary users on the automation platform basics.
    *   Develop automation workflows, leveraging templates and pre-built options where available.
    *   Test workflows with real data in a controlled environment and refine based on test results and user feedback.
    *   Prepare comprehensive documentation and user guides for the automated system.
    *   Go live with a pilot user group, monitor performance daily, and make adjustments as needed.
    *   Analyze performance data to continuously optimize workflows.
    *   Expand automation to additional users only after successful piloting.
    *   Document lessons learned and best practices throughout the implementation process.

3.  **Automated ROI Analysis and Measurement:**
    *   Establish success metrics and a robust measurement system at the foundation of the project.
    *   Begin measuring ROI metrics during the pilot phase of automation.
    *   Automate the calculation of Weekly Time Saved using the formula: (Process Time × Frequency) - (Automation Setup Time ÷ 52).
    *   Automate the calculation of Monthly Time Value using the formula: Weekly Time Saved × 4.33 × (Hourly Rate + 35% overhead).
    *   Automate the calculation of Monthly Error Value using the formula: (Current Error Rate - Automated Error Rate) × Process Frequency × Average Error Cost.   
    *   Automate the calculation of Capacity Increase Value using the formula: Additional Output Enabled × Unit Value.
    *   Automate the calculation of Monthly Implementation Cost using the formula: (Platform Cost + Setup Time Cost + Training Cost) ÷ 12.
    *   Automate the calculation of 30-Day ROI using the formula: ((Monthly Value × 1) - Monthly Implementation Cost) ÷ Monthly Implementation Cost × 100.
    *   Calculate and report 30-day ROI results upon completion of the initial implementation phase.
    *   Continuously measure ROI to build a strong business case for expanded automation initiatives.
    *   Employ formula-based rules within automated systems for precise and deterministic ROI calculations.
    *   Utilize derivation rules to generate new values based on existing data for ROI components.
    *   Incorporate validation rules to ensure data quality and integrity for ROI calculations.

4.  **Mitigating Risks in Automation for ROI:**
    *   Verify all system integrations thoroughly during platform evaluation to prevent delays and cost overruns.
    *   Avoid initial designs that are overly complicated; start simply and add complexity gradually to ensure manageable implementation.
    *   Do not neglect change management; invest adequately in communication, training, and support for users.
    *   Set realistic timelines for achieving ROI, avoiding expectations of complex automations delivering 30-day ROI.
    *   Match the automation platform's complexity to actual requirements, favoring ease of use for quick wins.

TOP 5 BUSINESS RULES FOR QUERY:

    ABC Customer SabseBadaRupaiya wants to build a Fund Manager Application for use by its talented money manager and esteemed customers. The Fund Manager Application will allow customer login, capture customer details, risk profile, investment amount. It will maintain each customer's current portfolio and update on real-time basis.
The application will be used by the manager to pool customer investments, and aid the manager in decision-making (algorithmic suggestions) to invest in various options such as fixed deposits, stocks, and mutual funds, again on real-time basis. The application should analyze return on investment options automatically by checking the web e.g. FD interest rates across banks, stock prices and mutual funds NAVs.
The goal is to build an LLM-driven application-builder that can "quickly" build this application for SabseBadaRupaiya, who insists that this application should attempt to deliver 10 percent returns for customers. Once done, ABC wants to market this as a magic fintech app-builder and sell-as-service to multiple customers, with possibly higher returns targeted.
